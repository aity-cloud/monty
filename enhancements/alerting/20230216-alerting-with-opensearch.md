# Title:

Alerting Integration with OpenSearch

## Summary:

Allow end-users to be alerted on opensearch data as an alarm type in Monty-Alerting

## Use case:

- End-users gain access to Monty-Alerting features on logging observability data and by extension, Monty-Alerting features on AiOps logging insights

## Benefits:

- Use Monty-Alerting with Logging & AiOps

## Impact:

- Logging will have to implement logging admin APIS for interacting with:
  - OpenSearch monitors (CRUD)
  - OpenSearch monitor status
  - OpenSearch destinations (CRUD)
- Alerting Gateway plugin will embed a logging admin client

## Implementation details:

### Logging Admin Changes

```proto
service LoggingAdminV2 {
  //....

  // ======= monitors =======

  // core.Reference refers to the monitor id

  rpc GetMonitor(core.Reference) returns (OpensearchMonitor){}
  rpc MonitorStatus(core.Reference) returns(MonitorStatus) {}
  rpc ListMonitors(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (OpensearchMonitorList){}
  rpc LoadMonitor(OpensearchMonitor) returns (core.Reference){}
  rpc DeleteMonitor(core.Reference) returns (google.protobuf.Empty){}

  rpc SilenceMonitor(core.Reference) returns (google.protobuf.Empty){}

  // destinations

  rpc ListDestinations(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (OpensearchDestinationList){}
  rpc LoadDestination(OpenSearchDestination) returns (google.protobuf.Empty){}

}

enum OpensearchAlertStatus{
  Completed = 0;
  Active = 1;
  Acknowledged = 2;
  Deleted = 3;
  Error = 4;
}

message MonitorStatus {
  repeated items = 1;
}

message OpensearchMonitor{
  core.Reference clusterId = 1;
  // same convention as metrics : doesn't make sense to wrap complex JSON data in complex grpc protobufs
  byte monitor = 2;
}

message OpensearchMonitorList{
  repeated OpensearchMonitor items = 1;
}

message OpensearchDestination{
    // same convention as metrics : doesn't make sense to wrap complex JSON data in complex grpc protobufs
  byte monitorDestination = 1;
}

message OpensearchDestinationList{
  repeated OpensearchDestination items = 1;
}
```

`MonitorStatus` wraps the [persisted alerts status](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/observing-your-data/alerting/monitors/#work-with-alerts) for the associated monitor.

Alerting uses `LoadMonitor` to create the OpenSearch dependencies required to activate the alarm.

`LoadMonitor` bundles the [Create monitor](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/observing-your-data/alerting/api/#create-a-query-level-monitor) & [Update monitor](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/observing-your-data/alerting/api/#update-monitor) apis depending on what operation is appropriate. The reason is to be semantically and ideologically in line with the existing internal monty alarms and cortex alarms :

1. they are stateless
2. alerting's only concern is whether or not the monitor spec is loaded

`SilenceMonitor` wraps the [acknowledge alert api](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/observing-your-data/alerting/api/#acknowledge-alert)

`DeleteMonitor` wraps the [Delete monitor api](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/observing-your-data/alerting/api/#update-monitor).

`ListDestinations` wraps the [Get destinations api](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/observing-your-data/alerting/api/#get-destinations)

`LoadDestination` wraps the [create destination api](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.4/observing-your-data/alerting/api/#create-destination)

### OpenSearch Query Alarm(s)

We should implement a base proto message for generic opensearch monitor queries.
This should not be exposed to end users in the UI. Eventually, we may be able to proxy opensearch query builders in the UI for easily building these.

```proto
message AlertConditionOpensearchQuery{
  core.Reference clusterId = 1;
  string queryDSL = 2;
  string trigger = 3;
  google.protobuf.Duration interval = 4;
}
```

- `clusterId` field modifies the source index on the monitor to apply only to the specified cluster

- `queryDSL` field sets the query on the monitor. query for the monitor abides by the [query DSL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/observing-your-data/alerting/monitors/#create-a-monitor)

- `trigger` field maps to the monitor's trigger field, it is fundamentally a `Painless` script that returns true or false

- `interval` field maps to query-level monitors' field:

```
"schedule": {
    "period": {
      "interval": 1,
      "unit": "MINUTES"
    }
  }
```

The actions field on the monitor will always be implicitly set by Monty-Alerting based on the alarm configuration.

The actions field always points to the monty-gateway address and the new trigger alerting `TriggerWithHook` api.

The logic for creating & translating these fields will go into `pkg/alerting/drivers/opensearch`.

<hr/>

For this to opensearch alarm to work we also need to accept open search alerts via an API, to forward them to alertmanager:

```proto
service NotificationService {
  // ...

  rpc ProxyOpenSearchTrigger(google.protobuf.Any) returns (google.protobuf.Empty) {
    option(google.api.http) = {
      post : "/opensearch/alarms"
    }
  }
}
```

the `ProxyOpenSearchTrigger` api parses the `opensearch webhook destination` message JSON contents inside the API, and posts the information to the AlertManager cluster.

#### Log Anomaly Count Alarm

An easy to use template for the base alert condition that alerts the user when the log anomaly count is breached based on their configuration `AlertConditionOpenSearchQuery`

```proto
message AlertConditionLogAnomalyCount{
  core.Reference clusterId = 1;
  google.protobuf.Duration interval = 2;
  uint64 count = 3;
  // ...
  // open to extension for resource filters
}
```

#### Log Keyword Count Alarm

An easy to use template for the base alert condition that alerts the user when the keyword count they specify is breached `AlertConditonOpenSearchQuery`

```proto
message AlertConditionLogKeywordCount {
  core.Reference clusterId = 1;
  google.protobuf.Duration interval = 2;
  uint64 count = 3;
  repeated string keywordsRe = 4;
  // ...
  // open to extension for resource filters
}
```

### Alerting Gateway plugin miscellaneous changes

- Embed the `LoggingAdminV2` client in the alerting gateway plugin in the existing `func (p *Plugin) UseAPIExtensions(intf system.ExtensionClientInterface)`

- `AlertConditionStatus` & `ListStatusAlertCondition` APIs should return `Pending` state for Opensearch alarms if the associated monitor doesn't exist in Opensearch. The `Reason` field on the returned state can include more details.

- `AlertConditionStatus` & `ListStatusAlertCondition` APIs need to also get the state from the Monitors using `MonitorStatus`, with the following mappings `OpenSearch -> MontyAlerting`:

  - `Acknowledged` ----> `Silence` (when an OpenSearch admin acknowledges it from OpenSearch, propagate that change to MontyAlerting in the form of a silence)
  - `Completed` ----> `Ok`
  - `Active` ----> `Firing`
  - `Error`/`Deleted` ----> `Invalidated` (when something is deleted through a source other than monty alerting, or something is severely wrong). The `Reason` field should specify additional details

#### Sync loop

alerting sync loop needs to handle some additional sync tasks

- if logging is enabled, check the monty-alerting webhook that points `ProxyOpenSearchTrigger` always exists

- if an opensearch monitor is acknowledged, but not silenced, silence it in monty-alerting
- if a logging alarm condition is silenced, but not acknowledged in opensearch, acknowledge it

### UI/UX

- UI implements the OpenSearch alarm type

## Acceptance criteria:

### Logging

- [ ] Logging admin APIs that CRUD opensearch monitors
- [ ] Logging admin APIs that check Monitor status through associated persisted alerts
- [ ] Logging admin APIs for loading & listing opensearch destinations

### Alerting

- [ ] Opensearch query alarm type
  - [ ] input construction of protocol buffer to Opensearch monitors
  - [ ] extensive input validation to constructions
  - [ ] trigger hook api that accepts webhook message contents
- [ ] Opensearch monitor status mapping to MontyAlerting alarm status
- [ ] Push/apply updates to opensearch dependencies inside the alerting push stream syncing logic

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Query & trigger DSL may be too complicated to construct & validate on the alerting side | Recreate the fields of the visual editor for opensearch monitors, which would reduce the scope of allowed configurations for the query & trigger DSLs but would be easier to construct & validate |

## Level of Effort:

~ 4-5 weeks

- 5 days logging admin apis
- 5-10 days Opensearch query alarm : dsl inputs and parsing google.protobuf.Any is tricky
- 5 days misc gateway changes , e.g. non-alerting push-stream criteria to apply to external sources
- 5 days : some e2e test automation for logging + alerting integration is required due to the complexity of interactions
